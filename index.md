# Getting customer support
{: #getting-customer-support}


If you experience problems with {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}}, you have several support options, such as getting help through a forum, or opening a support ticket.
{:shortdesc}


## Getting help
{: #getting-help}
To find help options or open a support ticket, you can use the Support widget. To search for information or post questions, you can go directly to the Stack Overflow forum for technical issues or the developerWorks (dW) Answers forum for other questions. If you are using an account that is linked between {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} and {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer}}, see [Using the Support widget for linked accounts](#using-avatar-linked) and [Opening a support ticket for linked accounts](/docs/support/index.html#open-ticket-linked).  


### Using the Support widget
{: #using-avatar}
The Support widget enables you to get help and provide feedback.

To open the Support widget, log in to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console. On the menu bar, click **Support** and select **Find Answers** to locate answers to your questions. Enter your question in the search field to display answers from across the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} documentation and Stack Overflow.

## Viewing Bluemix status
{: #viewing-bluemix-status}

The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Status page is the central place to find notifications and announcements about key events that are affecting the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform and the major services in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.

On the Status page, you can find the following information:

  * The current status of services and components in all {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} regions.
  * A list of announcements, in chronological order, for maintenance and incidents. You can filter the list or open an individual announcement for more details.
  * Planned maintenance windows, which are posted at least 24 hours in advance, except in extreme circumstances.
  * Unplanned incidents or outages, which are posted as soon as the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} team becomes aware of them. Incident notifications are regularly updated until they are resolved.
  * References to security bulletins that affect the various {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services or the platform.
  * Other platform-wide announcements of general interest to you.
  * [An RSS feed to which you can subscribe](#subscribing-rss-feed).

You can find the Status page by choosing either of the following options:

  * Log in to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console. From the menu bar, click **Support** and select **Status**. Check the listed resources for the ![some issues](images/some_issues.svg) icon. This icon might indicate an outage.
  * Access it directly at [IBM {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} - Status ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://console.bluemix.net/status){: new_window}.


### Best practices for monitoring status
{: #best-practices}

  * Check for upcoming maintenance windows

	Check for upcoming maintenance windows posted on the status page, at least once every 24 hours, by using one of the following options:
	  * By navigating directly to the [Status ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://console.bluemix.net/status){: new_window} page
	  * By using the RSS feed or an RSS-to-email forwarder

  * Check for current maintenance windows or an incident in progress

	If you suspect that {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} is not functioning as expected, check the status page for current maintenance windows or an incident in progress. To report an incident that is not already listed on the status page, open a Support ticket by clicking **Support** and selecting **Add Ticket** on the menu bar or by accessing the [IBM Bluemix Support ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://www.ibm.biz/bluemixsupport){: new_window} help page.

  * Take advantage of multiple {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} regions

    All users of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public automatically have access to the US-SOUTH, EU-GB, EU-DE, and AU-SYD regions. The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Global Operations team manages all regions to avoid maintenance impacts and minimize the risk of incidents that affect all regions at the same time.
    
    To switch regions, from the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} menu bar, expand the region menu, and then select another region.

  * Prepare for minor interruptions

    In most cases, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} can continue to be used normally, even during the maintenance window. However, minor interruptions of a service can't always be avoided. Running applications typically remain available even if the application management functions of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, such as starting and stopping apps, are temporarily interrupted. To maximize the availability of your running applications, run at least three instances of each application.

### How different services are supported
You define the severity of the issue based upon your business needs and your level of support. All tickets are investigated with the purpose of identifying and resolving the root cause. When problem diagnostic data is needed to determine the root cause of the issue, you will be asked for approval to access log files and other problem determination data from your application. Without this data, the resolution of your issue might be delayed. After the root cause analysis is completed, the team with take one of the following actions based on the root cause:
* IBM generally available service or container image<br>
If the root cause analysis determines that the issue is a defect in the IBM generally available service or container image, the ticket is addressed based upon the severity that you assign.
* IBM Beta service or container image<br>
IBM will release services or container images that are classified as a Beta release. A Beta release helps IBM development and marketing teams assess the value of the service in the market. As a result, they can make adjustments before potentially releasing it as a generally available service or container image. If the root cause analysis determines that the issue is a defect in the IBM Beta service or container image, then IBM is not obligated to provide a fix. Additionally, the ticket is assigned a severity 3 or 4 as appropriate. 
* IBM experimental service or container image<br>
IBM will release services or container images that are classified as experimental. These services might be unstable, change frequently, and might be discontinued with a short notice. For services that are classified as experimental, you can obtain community assistance for technical issues through [Stack Overflow ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ibm-bluemix){: new_window} and other issues through [dW Answers ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://developer.ibm.com/answers/smart-spaces/12/bluemix.html){: new_window} only.
* Third-party service<br>
Third-party services are provided by vendors outside of IBM. These services are provided by individual software entities, partners, or independent software vendors (ISV). If the root cause analysis determines that the issue is a defect in a third-party service, then IBM is not obligated to provide a fix. However, IBM will work through our Marketplace with the third-party service and our client to help solve the issue. 
* Open source or community service<br>
Open source or community services are provided by open source communities outside of IBM. If the root cause analysis determines that the issue is a defect in an open source or community service, then IBM is not obligated to provide a fix. IBM will close the ticket and refer you to the community or forum for assistance. 


### Reporting a potential security vulnerability
{: #report-security-vulnerability}

If you believe a potential security vulnerability occurs, report it to Bluemix by opening a support ticket.

### Escalating a support ticket
{: #escalation}

With standard or premium support, if you have not received a timely response to a support ticket, or if you feel that a support ticket is not being addressed appropriately, you can escalate the support ticket. Through the support ticket escalation process, IBM management reviews your concerns and works with you to improve the support experience.

To submit an escalation request, complete the following steps:
  1. Open a new support ticket with the summary **Escalation Request**.
  2. To ensure that your escalation request can be matched with the original support ticket, include the following information in the body of the ticket:

The scripts use the cf command line interface to extract the following information from your application environment:

  * Application logs
  * Application metadata
  * Configured routes
  * Events
  * Provisioned services

## Satisfaction surveys for Bluemix support  
{: #survey}
