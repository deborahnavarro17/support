{: #best-practices}

### Check for upcoming maintenance windows
{: #monbp-checmaintwin}

Check for upcoming maintenance windows posted on the Status page, at least once every 24 hours, by using one of the following options:

* Using the RSS feed or an RSS-to-email forwarder

### Check for current maintenance windows or an incident in progress
{: #monbp-checcurmaninprog}

If you suspect that {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} is not functioning as expected, check the Status page for current maintenance windows or an incident in progress. To report an incident that is not already listed on the Status page, open a support ticket by clicking **Support** and selecting **Add Ticket** on the menu bar or by accessing the [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Support ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://www.ibm.biz/bluemixsupport){: new_window} help page.

### Take advantage of multiple {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} regions
{: #monbp-multpreg}

All users of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public automatically have access to the US-SOUTH, EU-GB, EU-DE, and AU-SYD regions. The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Global Operations team manages all regions to avoid maintenance impacts and minimize the risk of incidents that affect all regions at the same time.

To switch regions, from the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} menu bar, expand the region menu, and then select another region.

### Prepare for minor interruptions
